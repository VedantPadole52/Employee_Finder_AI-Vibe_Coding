## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable AI Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/4bca529b-1bb4-45dc-acb7-47fc00e1572a) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.


🚧 Why I Built This

- As someone learning to build real-world applications, I wanted to focus on understanding product design, data flow, and AI tool integration — instead of starting purely with code. Lovable allowed me to:
- Prototype a real-world solution quickly
- Focus on logic, flow, and user experience
- Learn how AI tools can assist development
- Understand how to structure apps without needing to manually code every part


🧠 What I Learned

- How no-code AI tools work in practice
- Basics of app logic and workflow automation
- Importance of UI/UX in functional web apps
- How to communicate between front-end features and backend data (even if assisted)


💡 Future Plans

- Rebuild parts of the app manually (e.g. using React or Next.js)
- Add database integration (e.g. Firebase, MongoDB)
- Add authentication and user roles
- Improve matching algorithm manually


📌 Disclaimer

This project was built with the help of the Lovable AI platform. Some parts of the logic and UI were generated or assisted by the platform. I focused on understanding the app's structure, features, and the role of AI in accelerating development. This project is part of my learning journey in tech and software development.
